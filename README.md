AutoMapper is a simple little library built to solve a deceptively complex problem - getting rid of code that mapped one object to another.

In this project, We use super heros list of collection and mapped the object. This is absolute beginner level. I have created to APIs in the controller. First, to get all the super heros some detail using AutoMapper. Second, Add new super hero using AutoMapper and retrieve all the updated super heros.
